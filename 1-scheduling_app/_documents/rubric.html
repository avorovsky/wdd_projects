<h3 id="value-10">Value: 10%</h3>
<p>Create your database tables in MySQL. These should be the tables required for your project and should include, at a minimum:</p>
<p>A customer or user table with all required fields for user registration, creation of invoices, etc. This must include full address fields, email, phone, password, etc.</p>
<p>An invoice table (or equivalent) to record sales. If you are not creating an eCommerce site, this should be a table that records a transaction of some kind. For example, adding articles to a library. This table and its data will demonstrate your ability to allow users to navigate your site and collect information. For those who are allowing only single item purchases (eg a subscription), this table will record all information about the purcase, including the product id, name, and price at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>A product table (or equivalent). This table is your primary table and will be used in the back end to demonstrate full CRUD capability. It should have all required field types as discussed earlier in the PHP courses. The fields included will vary depending on the type of project. If your site is an ecommerce site, it should have a quantity_in_stock field (or equivalent) that will be reduced each time a successful purchase is made. If your site is not ecommerce, it must have an equivalent field that can record user interaction with the data in the table (eg, no of times bookmarked, added to library, or even number of times viewed)</p>
<p>Note: all tables must have a created_at and updated_at field. The created at field must be timestamped when the record is created. The updated_at field should be timestamped every time the record is updated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum three tables</li>
<li>All required fields in table 1</li>
<li>All required fields in table 2</li>
<li>All required fields in table 3</li>
<li>Minimum 20 records in primary table (products)</li>
</ul>
<p>Database tables will be marked in class. You will be asked to demonstrate the tables using the mysql monitor.</p>

<h3 id="value-10">Value: 10%</h3>
<p>The proposal for the PHP capstone is based on the proposal you wrote for your HTML Capstone project. Your HTML capstone can be edited, modified, and added to, to create the proposal required for the PHP Capstone.</p>
<p>When the proposal is marked on day 2 of the PHP Capstone project, you only need to hand in a PDF. For final submission, at the end of the PHP Capstone, you must hand in a printed and bound version of the proposal.</p>
<p>These are the requirements of the original HTML Capstone, which are still in place for the PHP Capstone.</p>

<li>A detailed description of the kind of data you are collecting in your tables</li>

<ul>
<li>password encryption</li>
<li>XSS protection</li>
<li>CSRF protection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Updated wirframes and design mockups showing all new dynamically generated pages, including all back end/administrative pages</li>
<li>Updated sitemap/story-board showing all new pages on the front end</li>
<li>A second sitemap for the back-end/admin site. Be sure to include all pages in your CRUDS, even the ones that will not be completed for this project.</li>
<li>A conceptual data model (high level, without fields) of your project database</li>
<li>A detailed ERD of your data model (including fields and keys). eg: from MySQL workbench, or created manually in Open Office Draw.</li>

<p>Because many new elements have been added to your site (if it is based on your HTML project), all pages of your site, front end and back-end, will be reviewed and marked to ensure it has maintained the level of quality and professionalism you achieved in the static HTML project. It is very easy to break validation when PHP or Javascript elements are added. You must ensure this does not happen.</p>
<p>If you are working on a new site for the PHP Capstone project, you must ensure that it meets all the requirements, in terms of design, aesthetics and coding quality, of the original HTML project.</p>
<p>Your files will be reviewed in the browser, as browser source... NOT in your raw files and includes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Design/Aesthetics</li>
<li>HTML Validation</li>
<li>CSS Validation</li>
<li>Completeness of forms (all required fields)</li>

<li>Formatting and indentation of HTML</li>
<li>Formatting and indentation of CSS</li>
<li>Formatting of forms and input fields... make sure these are readable, and break them into multiple lines if you have to.</li>
